# Project description

DRythm is decentralized platform for sharing music i.e uploading and downloading musics. It is permissionless platform that brings music sharing onto the blockchain. Users are able to access the platform via their wallet addresses and pay for the service in the platform token - *"RYM"*. 

## How it works
There are basically two types of users: 

### Uploader: 
Could be anyone licensed to handle such songs or the singer themselves.
They earn continuosly on each song they uploaded whenever it is consumed by others.

### Downloader
This a category of users that actually consume the songs/file uploaded. They pay a very minimal amount as fee for downloading any songs (either video or audio). The fee is collected and divided between the platform and the Uploader of the song. 
The amount accrued to the platform is sent to a blackhole i.e burnt. This mechanism is healthy for the growth of the platform and its token.

# Why build this?
Music is life. Infact everyone loves music. We all have at least one song that ministers courage, hope, etc to us. It is our soft point. Sometimes ago, I was looking to download some songs. I visited Amazon only to discovered it would cost me about $130 to download just 2 songs. My status wasn't going to make me afford such amount. 

I thought about: 

- What if we have such platform that runs on the blockchan?
- What about the world where everyone should be able to afford something that really makes them happy.
- How can we remove such gigantic cost?

I found an answer while brainstorming. Blockchain is perfect for this. With its accomodating nature, we could leverage blockchain to provide such service that makes people happy.
